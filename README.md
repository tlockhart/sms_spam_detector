# SMS Spam Text Classification: Machine Learning Model

## Summary

This repository hosts a Jupyter Notebook showcasing a machine learning model designed to classify SMS messages as spam or not spam. The model uses `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text messages into numerical feature representations and a `LinearSVC` (Support Vector Machine) model for classification. The project includes a Gradio user interface for easy interaction.

### Key Features:
1. **SMS Message Input**: The Gradio UI provides an input box where users can submit an SMS message.
2. **Classification Output**: The UI displays whether the SMS message is classified as "spam" or "not spam" in an output box.
